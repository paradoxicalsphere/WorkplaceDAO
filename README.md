## Establishing an Incorruptible DAO Within Existing Organizations and Workplaces

<!-- The Sterzik Test: Does an IT tool aim to help or replace people? Good ideas aim to help people. Ideas destined to fail aim to replace people. -->

### Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The following documents aim to provide context for further planning and development related to establishing a successful DAO within an existing organization or workplace:

- [Pitch](./docs/Pitch.md)
- [Solution Approach](./docs/SolutionApproach.md)
- [Scenarios and Use Cases](./docs/UseCases.md)

<!-- 241030 - In our online meeting today, ROSO said that DAOs have some hierarchy (presumably speaking from his experience in RnDAO). He did not elaborate. He seemed to offer the information as a criticism of the idea discussed in the current proposal. However, the comment seems to validate that some additional structure is required in order to establish a sustainable, egalitarian DAO practically. -->
