### Description

To date, most Web 3.0 collaboration technology implementations seem to occur outside more traditional, mature industries and markets. The current proposal aims to provide context for requirements analysis and solution identification to support a given initiative or long-term planning related to establishing a successful decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) within an existing organization or workplace.

Helping Web 2.0 businesses realize potential of implementing Web 3.0 collaboration technologies to improve organizational or workplace effectiveness may play a role in successfully achieving Web 3.0 mass adoption.

<!-- ANOTHER IDEA: Collaboration technology for children or education would seem to be another good idea in general. -->
