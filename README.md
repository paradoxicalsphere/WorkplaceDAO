# Introduction

To date, most Web 3.0 collaboration technology implementations seem to occur outside more traditional and mature industries and markets.

The following documents aim to provide context for requirements analysis and solution identification for a given initiative or long-term planning related to establishing a successful decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) within an existing organization or workplace:

- [Pitch](./Pitch.md)
- [Solution Approach](./SolutionApproach.md)
- [Scenarios and Use Cases](./UseCases.md)

Helping Web 2.0 businesses realize potential of implementing Web 3.0 collaboration technologies to improve the effectiveness of organizations and workplaces may play a role in successfully increasing adoption.
