## Executive Summary<a name="summary"></a>

Most commonly, traditional organizational structures are hierarchical. Similarly, members in a labor union elect a centralized leadership. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) offer a model for decision making distributing voting rights across all members, typically with no central authority—only the will of the collective. Within an existing organization or workplace, DAO members may assume a share of duties and responsibilities usually associated with management levels. The relationship between DAOs and labor unions is complementary.

Sustainability in business refers to a company's strategy and actions to reduce adverse environmental and social impacts resulting from business operations in a particular market. An organization’s sustainability practices are typically analyzed against environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics.<sup><a href="#IBM">1</a></sup> DAOs have been heralded as the future of governance, unlocking a more egalitarian approach to decision making.

In a DAO, decision-making power typically is associated with one or more tokens created on a blockchain. Tokens represent a form of resource allocation. A blockchain is a digital ledger used to track token resource allocation immutably. Historically, DAOs rely on token-weighted governance, which is plutocratic. In other words, users with the most tokens have the biggest share of voting power. Unfortunately, token-weighted governance models can inadvertently end up handing over control to a few participants holding the majority of tokens, stripping influence away from the many.<sup><a href="#SashaIvanov">2</a></sup>

The current proposal offers a solution approach for implementing a DAO within an existing organization or workplace. DAOs established within existing organizations or workplaces may be more resilient, effective and successful than DAOs standing alone. Leveraging structures and strengths already established within more traditional organizational structures ensures that a DAO remains incorruptible over time.

Also, establishing a DAO may help increase employee engagement and improve decision-making capabilities to prepare and position an existing organization or workplace for a future where Web 3.0 solutions facilitate cooperation and collaboration at scales previously not possible.

Organizations and workplaces establishing DAOs may be more adaptable, resilient and vibrant in response to changing social and market conditions, becoming more productive and competitive. Establishing a DAO may help an organization or workplace continue to attract the best talent in the next generations of workers.

The proposal aims to describe solution components—such as new processes and software applications—as well as methodologies to establish a DAO successfully in an existing organization or workplace.

<!-- "DAOs have been around for about five years, and corporations have been around for about 400 years. Let's let things play out over the next 20 years or so." --Kevin Owocki -->

## Inputs and Outputs<a name="io"></a>

Determining the solution approach relies on the following inputs:

- Business need
- Organizational process assets
- Required capabilities

Use the solution approach to define the solution scope.

## Assumptions and Constraints<a name="assumptions"></a>

DAOs offer a model specifically for ratifying decisions. In the current proposal, existing resources, processes and workflows available within organizations and workplaces for analysis, evaluation, planning, elicitation, collaboration, design, management and communication inform the collective decisions that a DAO may make. Determining the solution scope identifies the business decisions entrusted to a DAO. 

The current proposal is constrained to examining how to implement an incorruptible DAO using a token-weighted governance model within existing organizations or workplaces. Establishing different governance models—such as [quadratic voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GRt0j698T4)—while also promising and worthy of further investigation, is outside the scope of the current proposal.

<!-- TO-DO: Discuss with Gema Diaz the potential responsibilities as well as the limits of responsibilities for such a DAO established within an organization or workplace, considering employment law. -->

The integrity of voting in a DAO requires:<sup><a href="#KevinOwocki">3</a></sup>

- Decentralization of voting power
- Accurate identification of DAO members<sup><a href="#WikipediaSybil">4</a></sup>
- DAO members NOT colluding to vote to each other's advantage

A dual role, or dual relationship, is one in which there are two (or more) distinct kinds of relationship with the same person or entity. Employee members of a DAO maintain a dual role within the organization or workplace. While dual relationships always introduce greater complexity, they are not inherently exploitative. Indeed, the increased human engagement through a dual relationship is far more likely to be affirming, reassuring and enriching than exploitative. The following practical guidelines are designed to help navigate dual relationships:<sup><a href="#SterzikBlog">5</a></sup>

- Acknowledge the nature of dual roles in a relationship.
- Be explicit and clear about the role that applies at a given point in time in a relationship.
- Do not confuse roles in a relationship. Stay within the bounds of the role that applies at a particular point in time in the relationship.
- Be willing to engage in an ongoing discussion regarding the integrity of a dual relationship.
- Be willing to make changes in behaviour to preserve the integrity of relationships, including ending the dual nature if integrity of the relationship cannot be preserved otherwise.

Successful DAOs build cooperation.<sup><a href="#Veritasium">6</a></sup> Working to build—or rebuild—trust requires good, positive and ongoing communication reinforcing truthfulness, integrity and reliability, and comes with no guarantee of success.<sup><a href="#SterzikTrust">7</a></sup>

While seeming more inefficient, the process of a DAO may be important for developing an effective organization or workplace.

## Solution Components<a name="components"></a>



### New Processes<a name="components"></a>

When designing a DAO, the solution approach informs the solution scope.

The DAO architecture introduces a new decision-making apparatus that provides opportunities to select and move people into positions of success, power and influence on the basis of demonstrated abilities and merit as a form of motivation.

In organizations and workplaces, managing roles and responsibilities while empowering employees to complete their day-to-day activities and duties successfully is a fundamental existing requirement. **In the current proposal, management—along with union leadership if applicable—regulates weighted voting and tokenomics, establishing constraints to maintain decentralization of voting power within the DAO. Existing or new workplace contracts, agreements, guidelines, codes of conduct or practices between the employer and employees preserve the integrity of DAO voting by accurately identifying DAO members and setting standards for professional ethical relationships.** Management, and union leadership if applicable, are empowered to revise the operating rules of the DAO in circumstances when the DAO begins to fail, noting that building cooperation is a primary objective of a DAO.

The membership of the DAO is comprised of employees. Depending on business needs, existing organizational processes and required capabilities, a DAO established in an organization or workplace collectively takes responsibility for some decision making that would otherwise be made by individual employees, smaller teams, management or union leadership.

Decision-making power in the form of DAO tokens is allocated based on assessments against key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs are "quantifiable measures of performance over time for a specific objective [providing] targets for [individuals and] teams [within organizations] to aim for; milestones to gauge progress; and, insights that help people across the organization make better decisions... [KPIs] help every area of the business move forward at the strategic level."<sup><a href="#KPIs">8</a></sup> Assessing employees against certain KPIs may help:

- Encourage all entities to make decisions that are in the broader interest of the organization or workplace, not just themselves.<sup><a href="#SashaIvanov">2</a></sup> 
- Amplify quieter voices
- Mitigate risks of losing social capital that may be associated with speaking up vocally and passionately
- Shift social engagement towards increasing cooperation

DAO tokens may relate directly to forms of compensation, such as salary, stock options, vacation time or other financial incentives.

<!-- Explore tying DAO tokens directly to salary, stock options, vacation or other financial incentives? https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/startups-from-solo-to-multiplayer-from-ad-hoc-to-systematic -->

For example, the solution scope may include, but not be limited to, deciding disbursements to selected charities and not-for-profit organizations within the local community that the organization may support.

Customers may benefit from improved organizational responsiveness and engagement that a DAO may enable.

### Software Applications<a name="software"></a>

The current proposal recommends building solutions using [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/).

In general, the solution approach requires a blockchain implementation supporting the following features:

- Smart contracts
- Tokens
- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
- Secure and private storage of employee data

<!-- What about privacy considerations, for DAO members transacting on chain? -->

Software application designs provide required features and functionality without users needing to understand the details of Web 3.0 technologies.<sup><a href="#Chainwire">9</a></sup>

<!-- The goal of the Toyota hackathon on Astar was "creating a support tool allowing anyone to create teams, issue governance tokens and vote without needing to understand the details of Web 3.0." The technology stack needed to implement the current proposal in an existing organization or workplace may have similar features requirements, although used in a more structured manner. -->

<!-- xWhat off-the-shelf software may FactoryDAO offer to help implement the proposed solution? IMPORTANT: Does FactoryDAO, and specifically the solutions that may be mentioned, build on Arbitrum? -->

<!-- xDiscuss privacy and security... namely, employee decisions should not be subject to scrutiny by the employer in the background. Similar privacy legislations that apply to e-mails that an employee may draft using a company computer should apply. Cite details from my CityU thesis. -->

<!-- xTO-DO: Discuss subnet and smart contract requirements of the solution as applicable to Arbitrum with Jordan Imran (Aragon) -->

## Methodology and Lifecycle<a name="methodology"></a>

<!-- How--by what means-- will the solution be delivered? -->

The current proposal considers the implementation of an incorruptible DAO within an existing organization or workplace as a long-term decision aiming to establish the DAO as a permanent collaborative and cooperative—rather than a short-term, finite or temporary—internal decision-making structure. If an organization or workplace is unionized, then the union must be involved in designing and establishing the DAO.

Successful implementation involves training and education for all stakeholders in a DAO. For example, education in preparation for establishing a DAO may include offering an introduction and practical experience related to fundamental game theory, such as the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma).

Game theory supposes that games may be finite or infinite. In a finite game, the goal is to win when the game ends. In an infinite game, the goal is to continue playing.<sup><a href="#JamesCarse">10</a></sup> Participants in a DAO need to know that infinite games may be played as finite games, in which case the game ends with winners and losers, just like any finite game. In a successful DAO within an organization or workplace, employees recognize the importance of responding to negative effects for the sustainability of the business.<sup><a href="#CHT">11</a></sup> All participants in the DAO need the intention—and need to understand the critical importance of the intention for the sustainability of the DAO as well as the organization—to continue actively making efforts to work in collaboration. Activities exploring how to contribute effectively as a member of a DAO may include playing games demonstrating that cooperation is more rewarding than self interest, particularly over time.

<!-- Use Greenpilled as a resource in planning the curriculum of the education deliverable. -->

The solution scope and rules incentivizing the day-to-day operation of a DAO may benefit from continuous improvement and refinement in response to unintended consequences. The current proposal recommends managing a DAO using a decision-making loop of observation, orientation, decision and action ([OODA](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/computer-science/the-ooda-loop)) with changes implemented weekly or monthly.

<!-- xTO-DO: Discuss methodologies with Andrea Gallagher -->

## Feasibility<a name="feasibility"></a>

<!-- How to assess whether an organization or workplace is capable of implementing and effectively using the solution? -->

Unhealthy and unsafe workplace practices may:

- Hinder organizational function
- Interfere with the capabilities of an organization to provide products and services to external stakeholders, and
- Create liabilities for workers' compensation insurers

The current solution approach suggests that organizations and workplaces recovering from and preventing toxic environments or negative interpersonal interactions may gain most from establishing a DAO, as an aspect of a wider strategy for continuous improvement.<sup><a href="#SterzikThesis">12</a></sup>

<!-- Perhaps as a starting point for determining solution scope, consider pain points within the organization, including decision making processes that are painful or ineffectual within the organization. -->

<!-- Discuss HR and employment standards that may apply to scope of DAO responsibilities -->

<!-- xDiscuss identified problems and problem statements -->

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

Effective organizations are typically more productive, often provide higher-quality services, and are usually more financially successful than less effective organizations.<sup><a href="#SterzikThesis">12</a></sup>

In recent years, managers in various industries have been burdened with workload due to an increase in business decision making and team management. Within constraints that management and labor unions may set, DAOs introduce a layer of operation into existing organizations and workplaces giving employees greater control and autonomy over their work while also helping to reduce managers' workloads.<sup><a href="#Chainwire">9</a></sup> Managers focus on providing the context team members need to prioritize and execute their high-impact work, increasing trust, engagement and ownership on teams helping employees have a greater impact on the company's growth.<sup><a href="#JuliaMartins">13</a></sup>
