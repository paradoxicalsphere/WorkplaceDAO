## Executive Summary<a name="summary"></a>

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) offer a model for decision making that distributes voting rights across all members. For example, whereas members in a labor union elect a centralized leadership, there is usually no central authority in a DAO—only the will of the collective. Within an existing organization or workplace, DAO members may assume a share of duties and responsibilities usually associated with management levels. The relationship between DAOs and labor unions is complementary.

DAOs have been heralded as the future of governance, unlocking a more egalitarian approach to decision making. In a DAO, decision-making power typically is associated with one or more tokens created on a blockchain. Tokens represent a form of resource allocation. A blockchain is a digital ledger used to track token resource allocation immutably. Historically, DAOs rely on token-weighted governance, which is plutocratic. In other words, users with the most tokens have the biggest share of voting power. Unfortunately, token-weighted governance models can inadvertently end up handing over control to a few participants holding the majority of tokens, stripping influence away from the many.<sup><a href="#SashaIvanov">1</a></sup>

**The current proposal offers a solution approach for implementing a DAO within an existing organization or workplace, leveraging the structures and strengths already established to ensure that the DAO remains incorruptible over time. DAOs established within existing organizations or workplaces may be more resilient, effective and successful than DAOs standing alone.**

Establishing a DAO may help prepare and position an existing organization or workplace to thrive in a future where Web3 solutions help solve problems of cooperation and collaboration at scales previously not possible. Organizations and workplaces establishing DAOs may be more adaptable, resilient and vibrant in response to changing social and market conditions, becoming more productive and competitive.

Establishing a DAO may help an organization or workplace continue to attract the best talent in the next generations of workers.

The proposal aims to describe solution components—such as new processes and software applications—as well as methodologies to establish a DAO successfully in an existing organization or workplace.

## Inputs and Outputs<a name="io"></a>

Determining the solution approach relies on the following inputs:

- Business need
- Organizational process assets
- Required capabilities

Use the solution approach to define the solution scope.

## Assumptions and Constraints<a name="assumptions"></a>

DAOs offer a model specifically for ratifying decisions. In the current proposal, existing resources, processes and workflows available within organizations and workplaces for analysis, evaluation, planning, elicitation, collaboration, design, management and communication inform the collective decisions that a DAO may make. Determining the solution scope identifies the business decisions entrusted to a DAO. 

The current proposal is constrained to examining how to implement an incorruptible DAO using a token-weighted governance model within existing organizations or workplaces. Establishing different governance models—such as [quadratic voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GRt0j698T4)—while also promising and worthy of further investigation, is outside the scope of the current proposal.

<!-- TO-DO: Discuss with Gema Diaz the potential responsibilities as well as the limits of responsibilities for such a DAO established within an organization or workplace, considering employment law. -->

The current proposal assumes that implementing an incorruptible DAO within an existing organization or workplace is a long-term decision aiming to establish the DAO as a permanent—rather than short-term or temporary—internal decision-making structure.

The integrity of voting in a DAO requires:<sup><a href="#KevinOwocki">2</a></sup>

- Decentralization of voting power
- Accurate identification of DAO members
- DAO members NOT colluding to vote to each other's advantage

Successful DAOs build cooperation.<sup><a href="#Veritasium">3</a></sup> Working to build—or rebuild—trust requires good, positive and ongoing communication reinforcing truthfulness, integrity and reliability, and comes with no guarantee of success.<sup><a href="#SterzikTrust">4</a></sup> While seeming inefficient, the process of a DAO may be important for developing an effective organization or workplace.

## Solution Components<a name="components"></a>



### New Processes<a name="components"></a>

The DAO architecture introduces a new decision-making apparatus that provides opportunities to select and move people into positions of success, power and influence on the basis of demonstrated abilities and merit as a form of motivation.

In organizations and workplaces, managing roles and responsibilities while empowering employees to complete their day-to-day activities and duties successfully is a fundamental existing requirement. **In the current proposal, management—along with union leadership if applicable—regulates weighted voting and tokenomics, establishing constraints to maintain decentralization of voting power. Existing or new workplace contracts, agreements, guidelines, codes of conduct or practices between the employer and employees preserve integrity of DAO voting by accurately identifying DAO members and setting standards for professional ethical relationships.** Management, and union leadership if applicable, are empowered to revise the operating rules of the DAO in circumstances when the DAO begins to fail, noting that building cooperation is a primary objective of a DAO.

The membership of the DAO is comprised of employees. Depending on business needs, existing organizational processes and required capabilities, a DAO established in an organization or workplace collectively takes responsibility for some decision making that would otherwise be made by individual employees, smaller teams, management or union leadership. For example, the solution scope may include, but not be limited to, deciding disbursements to selected charities and not-for-profit organizations within the local community that the organization may support.

Decision-making power in the form of DAO tokens is allocated based on assessments against key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs are "quantifiable measures of performance over time for a specific objective [providing] targets for [individuals and] teams [within organizations] to aim for; milestones to gauge progress; and, insights that help people across the organization make better decisions... [KPIs] help every area of the business move forward at the strategic level."<sup><a href="#KPIs">5</a></sup> Assessing employees against certain KPIs potentially encourages all entities to make decisions that are in the broader interest of the organization or workplace, not just themselves.<sup><a href="#SashaIvanov">1</a></sup>

Customers may benefit from improved organizational responsiveness and engagement that DAOs may facilitate.

When designing a DAO, the solution approach informs the solution scope.

### Software Applications<a name="software"></a>

<!-- What off-the-shelf software may FactoryDAO offer to help implement the proposed solution? -->

Software application designs provide required features and functionality without users needing to understand the details of Web 3.0 technologies.<sup><a href="#Chainwire">6</a></sup>

<!-- The goal of the Toyota hackathon on Astar was "creating a support tool allowing anyone to create teams, issue governance tokens and vote without needing to understand the details of Web 3.0." The technology stack needed to implement the current proposal in an existing organization or workplace may have similar features requirements, although used in a more structured manner. -->

<!-- TO-DO: Discuss subnet and smart contract requirements of the solution as applicable to Arbitrum with Jordan Imran (Aragon) -->

## Methodologies<a name="methodologies"></a>

<!-- How--by what means-- will the solution be delivered? -->

Over time, the solution scope and operating rules of a DAO may benefit from continuous improvement and refinement. The current proposal recommends managing a DAO using a decision-making loop of observation, orientation, decision and action ([OODA](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/computer-science/the-ooda-loop)) with changes implemented weekly or monthly.

<!-- Successful implementation involves training and education for all stakeholders in the DAO within the organization. For example, education in preparation for implementing a DAO includes an introduction and practice related to game theory, including the prisoners dilemma (use Greenpilled as a resource in planning the curriculum of the education). In finite games, the goal is to win. In an infinite game, the goal is to continue playing. Activities may include playing games that demonstrate cooperation is more rewarding for players than self-interest.

DAO participants must also understand that infinite games may be played as finite games, in which case the game ends just like a finite game, with winners and losers. In a DAO, any player who recognizes that the game may be ending has an obligation to change the rules so that the game may continue. All participants in the DAO need the intention, and need to understand the critical importance of the intention to the survival of the DAO, to keep playing the game, rather than ending the game. -->

<!-- If the organization or workplace is unionized, then the union must be involved in designing and establishing the DAO -->

<!-- Perhaps as a starting point for determining solution scope, consider pain points within the organization, including decision making processes that are painful or ineffectual within the organization. -->

<!-- TO-DO: Discuss methodologies with Andrea Gallagher -->

## Feasibility<a name="feasibility"></a>

<!-- How to assess whether an organization or workplace is capable of implementing and effectively using the solution? -->

<!-- Discuss HR and employment standards that may apply to scope of DAO responsibilities -->

<!-- What about privacy considerations, for DAO members transacting on chain? -->

<!-- Discuss identified problems and problem statements -->

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

Effective organizations are typically more productive, often provide higher-quality services, and are usually more financially successful than less effective organizations.<sup><a href="#SterzikThesis">7</a></sup>

In recent years, managers in various industries have been burdened with workload due to an increase in business decision making and team management. Within constraints that management and labor unions may set, DAOs introduce a layer of operation into existing organizations and workplaces giving employees greater control and autonomy over their work while also helping to reduce managers' workloads.<sup><a href="#Chainwire">6</a></sup> Managers focus on providing the context team members need to prioritize and execute their high-impact work, increasing trust, engagement and ownership on teams helping employees have a greater impact on the company's growth.<sup><a href="#JuliaMartins">8</a></sup>
