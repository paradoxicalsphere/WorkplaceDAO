## Helping Incentivize a Staking Community<a name="staking"></a>

In the scenario, one or more companies using more typically traditional hierarchical reporting structures are involved in developing and growing a Web 3.0 ecosystem. In the ecosystem, community members comprised of the general public may purchase and stake blockchain tokens to help secure the network. Stakeholders receive rewards.

Particularly within new Web 3.0 ecosystems, the risks of stakes becoming centralized may be higher. To mitigate the risks, the companies establish a DAO for employees that incentivizes making staking decisions in the interests of the ecosystem as a whole, rather than based on individual self interest. Management allocates tokens to employees for staking based on key performance indicators (KPIs). While employees may make decisions on how to stake allocated tokens within the ecosystem, features in the technology stack supporting the DAO prevent employees from spending allocated tokens and rewards.
