## Helping Incentivize a Staking Community<a name="staking"></a>

In the scenario, one or more companies are involved in developing and growing a Web 3.0 ecosystem. In the ecosystem, community members in the general public may purchase and stake blockchain tokens to help secure the network. Stakeholders receive rewards.

Particularly with a new ecosystem, the risks of stakes becoming centralized may be higher. To mitigate the risks, the companies establish a DAO for employees that incentivizes making decisions in the interests of the ecosystem as a whole, rather than based on individual self interest. Management allocates tokens to employees for staking based on key performance indicators (KPIs). While employees make decisions on how to stake allocated tokens, employees may not spend tokens or rewards.
