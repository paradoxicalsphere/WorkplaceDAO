# Scenarios and Use Cases

The following use cases describe how actors may interact with the [proposed solution](./SolutionApproach.md) to respond to events and accomplish business goals:

- [Designing a User Interface](#ui)
- [Accessing Global Human Capital](#humancapital)
- [Helping Incentivize a Staking Community](#staking)

## Designing a User Interface<a name="ui"></a>

A Project Manager with a multinational automative manufacturer gains responsibility for a project to redesign the user interface of a car. Leveraging an employee DAO, the Project Manager gives members of the project team autonomy over decisions related to the redesign.<sup><a href="#ToyotaHackathon">1</a></sup>

**Primary Actor:** Project Manager  
**Scope:**  Project to Redesign the User Interface of a Car Model  
**Level:** Summary

### Main Success Scenario

1. The Project Manager mints a new token in the employee DAO to support decision making in the project.
2. The Project Manager allocates and distributes the new token to project team members based on key performance indicators (KPIs).
3.

## Accessing Global Human Capital<a name="humancapital"></a>

A business having a traditional organization structure posts bounty jobs on the corporate Web site. Workers, who may be pseudonymous and work remotely, are members of a DAO within the organization supported by a [Web 5.0 platform](https://www.lcx.com/introduction-to-web-5-0/). When applying for bounty jobs, applicants may be short listed partially based on a blockchain-based reputation system using 360-degree reviews of past work experiences. Workers receive tokens representing decision-making power in the DAO based on reputation. Work and feedback are submitted using the blockchain. Payments for successfully completed jobs may be processed in fiat or cryptocurrencies. A history recording work experiences, reviews and payments for each worker, as needed to meet tax and regulatory requirements, is stored on the blockchain using non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

**Primary Actor:** Remote Pseudonymous Worker  
**Scope:**  Bounty Work Procurement System  
**Level:** Summary

### Main Success Scenario

1. A worker located anywhere in the world identifies a bounty job of interest on the company's Web site.
2. The worker applies for the job pseudonymously using zero-knowledge proofs of past work experiences and digital IDs (DIDs).
3. According to applicable employment standards and regulations, the worker is hired.
4. As a member of the DAO, the pseudonymous worker sends a digitally-signed contract and any required supporting documentation to the employer as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
5. In the process of completing work, the pseudonymous worker exchanges communications with the employer, including status reports and links to work drafts, using blockchain-based applications.
6. For successfully completed work, the worker submits invoices and payments are processed using the blockchain.
7. When the bounty job is complete, the worker reviews the work experience and receives a review from the company. Reviews are stored using NFTs.
8. The worker receives tax forms related to completed work that the company prepares according to regulations, also using NFTs.

<!-- Document the bounty work / gig worker scenario that Nick Almond described in response to my question(s) in his mentoring session -->

### Extensions

5a. Pseudonymous workers may form teams and make work-related decisions collectively.


## Helping Incentivize a Staking Community<a name="staking"></a>

One or more companies using more typically traditional hierarchical reporting structures are involved in developing and growing a Web 3.0 ecosystem. In the ecosystem, community members comprised of the general public may purchase blockchain tokens, and then stake tokens in pools to help secure the network and receive rewards.

Particularly within relatively new Web 3.0 ecosystems, the risks of stakes becoming centralized may be higher. To mitigate the risks, the companies establish a DAO for employees that incentivizes making staking decisions in the interests of the ecosystem as a whole, rather than based on individual self interest. Management allocates tokens to employees for staking based on key performance indicators (KPIs). While employees may make decisions on how to stake allocated tokens within the ecosystem, features in the technology stack prevent employees from spending allocated tokens and rewards.

**Primary Actor:** Employee  
**Scope:** Web 3.0 Staking Community  
**Level:** Summary

### Main Success Scenario

1. Based on the results of a successful annual performance review, the employee is allocated a number of tokens only for the purposes of staking to existing pools within the ecosystem.
2. As one of numerous day-to-day responsibilities, the employee maintains some awareness of behaviour in the staking community by engaging through a variety of news channels, social media and word of mouth.
3. The employee recognizes self-interested behaviour in the staking community that begins to centralize power too much. For example, a single pool may inadvertently begin gaining too much voting power through collusion, or a single entity may be indentified as operating multiple stake pools.
4. While the employee cannot punish self-interested behaviour that may occur, managing allocated staking tokens enables the employee to act meaningfully in the interests of the ecosystem as a whole to balance self-interested behaviour. For example, the employee may respond to centralization by staking tokens to one or more different, smaller pools reflecting the values of the employee and company. If the employee already stakes tokens to a pool identified as becoming too central in the ecosystem, then the employee may remove some stake from the pool.

### Extensions

3a. If the ecosystem seems to function well, then the employee may decide not to stake any allocated tokens.

4a. The employee may act in coordination and collaboration with other employees, as may be needed to maintain healthy decentralization within the ecosystem.
